Production Assignment

I struggled to understand how this works, and spent most of my time just trying to work it out. It started to make more sense at the end, but even though I did it, I am still not sure that the concept a hundred percent makes sense to me. 

Discussion topics:

1) The relationship between Robbie and Gloria reminded me of stories about children and animals, where Robbie's character could be a dog or a cat that the girl spends a lot of time with and starts seeing as a friend. How would their dynamic in the story change if Robbie was a pet instead of a robot?
2) How long do you think it will take our society to trust robots enough to be baby sitters? Would they make better baby sitters than humans since they are not subject to human error (eg falling asleep and not noticing the child putting itself in danger) or malicious intent (eg intentional abuse)? 
3) Is diviancy or divergence from core programming under certain circumstances a good idea or would it create more accidence than it can prevent?
4) How far should the diviancy extend? Should robots have certains rules progammed into them that cannot be broken? 
5) Who can emphatise with robots the most? Is it the general public and especially children, since htye dont know how they work? Or is it engineers and programmers, since they work with them and "get to know them" more than anyne else and are empathetic towards them as a result of the time they spend with them?
