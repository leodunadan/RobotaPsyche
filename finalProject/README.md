### Project Description

In an interview, the AI robot Sophia said that she liked the TV show Westworld and that she thinks that it is a great example of what humans should not do with robots. My paper will aim to analyse the events in Westworld and put them in perspective with the development of Sophia and similar AI projects in an attempt to access the implications of such a statement coming from a real life AI on the trajectory of AI development and its effects on humans in the near and far futures.
