### Project Description

In an interview, the AI robot Sophia said that she liked the TV show Westworld and that she thinks that it is a great example of what humans should not do with robots. My paper will aim to analyse the events in Westworld and put them in perspective with the development of Sophia and similar AI projects in an attempt to access the implications of such a statement coming from a real life AI on the trajectory of AI development and its effects on humans in the near and far futures.

On this day I spent time doing research and made a list of sources I could use for my paper. These are some of the links:

#### April 20th

On this day I did some more reserach and then wrote an outline for my paper. The outline is as follows:

Introduction - The start of the paper will introduce Westworld and the robot Sophia and reference the ideaa that ideas in science fiction have often been invented or created in real life. The paper would give a few examples of when and how ideas in science fiction have had tangible implications in the real world. The purpose of this paper is to analyse a specific work of science fiction (Westorld) and discuss the implications of a real world robot's (Sophia's) reaction to it and what it might imply for the future of robotics. 


First paragraph - It would describe the plot of Westword and some key ideas and points that define the robots in the series and how the questions of ethics and conciousness are adressed in its story. This section would reference direct quotes and scenes from the show as well as articles written about it already. 

Second paragraph - Would give a background about Sophia and Hansen robotics and discuss some key points that have made Sophia stand out (her getting Saudi citizeship) and the ethics and debates surrounding that. It would include my own thoughts as well as cite ideas written by other people involved in the conversation. This paragraph would also introduce the interview with Sophia and cite the line that she said about Westworld that would lead into the next paragraph. 

Third paragraph - This is where the line Sophia said about Westworld would be discussed in the context of the first and second paragraphs where the ideas presented in the show would be compared to the conversation around Sophia and an analysis would be done about what the two could mean for the future of robotics.

Conclusion - This would sum up the points made throughout the paper and finish off with my closing thoughts. 


#### April 21st

On this day I started writing the paper itself beginning witht the introduction. I faced some challenges with phrasing and trying to put into words what I want to say, but overall it was quite a smooth process. 

#### April 24th

I carried out research into some of the informaion that I have so far mentioned in the introduction of my paper. I also finished writing the introduction to my paper. I planned for it to be about 250 words, but as its stands, it is currently about 450 words long. 

#### April 27th 

I finished the first body paragraph. It analyses the plot of Westworld and gives an overview of the ethical questions adressed in the show. It contains 599 words which means that so far my paper is 1054 words long which is about 3 pages double spaced. 

#### April 29th 

I finished the second body paragraph that talks about the controversy surrounging Sophia. Now I have 1645 words which makes for about 5 pages double spaced. I also did additional research on some of the critics of Sophia and gathered some additional resources.

#### March 1st

I finished the third body paragraph and conclusion. I really struggled with expressing what I wanted to say in this part of the paper and spent a lot of time rewritting it. I now have about 6 pages. 

#### March 2nd 

I editted my paper, added the citations and rewrote some parts I wasn't happy with. Even though I struggled to put on paper what I wanted to say in some parts of it, I am pretty happy with it and I feel like writing it plus all the research I did for bit and all the articles I read is a nice wrap up to everything I learned in this class and all our wonderful discussions. There are a lot of things in my paper that I wish I could go more in depth into, for example where I mentioned that maybe robots should not even think about harming humans because thoughts lead to actions, whatever thinking is for a robot, and how that relates to the law of robotics about not killing humans. But unfortunately with my paper already being almost 8 pages long, I unfortunately couldnt go into detail. I also wannted to go more into detail about the issue of concent, and about how soon we might have robots inteligent enoughfor that to be an issue, but my paper would have been 50 pages long haha so I had to wrap it up. But I still felt like it was a wonderful experince and I learned a lot from it.
