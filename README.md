# RobotaPsyche
## February 8th - Assignment 1
I struggled a lot with the vector funtions (velocity.add and all those)and had to get back to Daniel's Youtube videos multiple times and I managed to get a better understanding of them even though i still find them confusing. I wanted to experiemnt with uploading an image and made the rocket more fun with a png image that I used in my code. I wanted to make the rocket roate when it changes direction and ended up using float theta = velocity.heading2D() in my code even though I didn't quite undersnad how it differs (if at all) from rotate(velocity.heading()) which is what Professor Michael showed us in class. Overall, this assignemt made me understand vectors a but betetr and I am happy that I could make my code work!
