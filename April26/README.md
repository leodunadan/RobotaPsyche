Discussion topics:

1) Susan asked "what makes a single robot so important to the project?" and it make me wonder if robots can ever have individuality. Like with humans, every single one is different and unique,  can that ever be the case with robots?
2) Should be restrict privaate development or funding of robotics? If we do not, how do we make sure that a billionare does not end up in the possession of something like the iron man suit through having had multiple robotics firms research it for years using their money?
3) Humans have adapted to figurative language, so if you tell someone to 'get lost' or anything similar, they would not take it literally. However a robot would. Can we program them to understand figurative speech, or is it going to be the case that peoplle have to be super careful with their words?
4) Wouldnt robot psychologists be the same people as the developers? If they built them then they should be aware of the possible problems, so why is there a need for other people?
5) Why is that in all of these stories there is always a human who is annoyed with robots?
