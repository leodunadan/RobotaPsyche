1) The robot's unwillingness to listen to facts even when presented as such seemed counter intuitive. If he was so logical, why did he not take direct evidence? And why did he not question it or consider it if he was otherwise very curious?
2) QT stopped listening to Powell and Donovan because he thought that he is superiour to them. Is this an actually threat humanity faces from AI in the future? What if robots actually think themselves better than us and decide to 'decommision' all humans on Earth? 
3) QT's dogmatic approach seems similar to the approaches of religious people to science historically. The frustration that Powell and Donovan experienced while arguing with him made me think of how Galileo must have felt when the Church insisted that contrary to evidence everything revolves around Earth and how agnostic scientists must feel when religious people tell them that humans are not a product of evolution of life on earth, but that they were made as is by a higher power. Is blind and unquestioning faith dangeorus? Isn't faith a man made concept created to explain the unexplainable? And if it is, how can a robot beileve in a higher power (the Master)
